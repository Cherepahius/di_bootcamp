          George Walton Lucas Jr.[1] (born May 14, 1944) is an American
          filmmaker and philanthropist. He created the Star Wars and Indiana
          Jones franchises and founded Lucasfilm, LucasArts, Industrial Light &
          Magic and THX. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to
          The Walt Disney Company in 2012.[2] Nominated for four Academy Awards,
          he is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers: he
          directed or conceived ten of the 100 highest-grossing movies at the
          North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation.[3] He
          is considered to be one of the most significant figures of the
          20th-century New Hollywood movement, and a pioneer of the modern
          blockbuster. Despite this, he has remained an independent filmmaker
          away from Hollywood for most of his career.[4]
